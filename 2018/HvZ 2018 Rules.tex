\section{Introduction}
Amendments will be added as additional rules with higher numbers. Thus it follows that:
\\
{\bf A higher number rule will always take priority over a lower numbered rule.}\\
Author's note: These rules seek to create a fair, inclusive playing field for all interested students. If you find any portion of these rules to be biased or offensive in anyway, please do not hesitate to contact a member of the administrator team. We will hold such grievances in complete confidence.

\section{Roles}

    \item {The Supreme Zombie Overlord}
    \item {The Number Two}

\titlecap{\SZOOP}~rulings are final but in extreme cases, a decision may be vetoed by a majority administrator vote which must include the \emph{Number Two}.

\subsection{The Number Two}

This year the \emph{Number Two} is \SIC.

\titlecap{\SICSP}~does the bidding of the \emph{Supreme Zombie Overlord}. During the absence of the \emph{Supreme Zombie Overlord},~\SICSP~will act in~\SZOOP~place.

Any grievances with the \emph{Supreme Zombie Overlord} must be reported to the \emph{Number Two}.

\titlecap{\SICSP}~holds all powers that any other administrator holds.

Sometimes the \emph{Number Two} likes to be called the ``Second in Command'' or ``2IC'' for short.
